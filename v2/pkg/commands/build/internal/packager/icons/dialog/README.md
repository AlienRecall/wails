# Default Dialog Icons

This directory contains the default dialog icons. These are pre-compiled into a single C file (`defaultDialogIcons.c`) which resides in the `ffenestri` directory. If these icons are ever updated, then there is a need to run: `go run build.go` in this directory. This will generate a new `defaultDialogIcons.c` file in the `ffenestri` directory.
